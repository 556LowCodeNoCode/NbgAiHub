ai_summary: The strongest verification habit in the hub — after Claude produces an output, ask it to verify its own work with real commands (grep the quotes, recompute the sums, re-run the logic) and show you the output. Commands either pass or fail; assurances always pass.

After Claude produces anything — a report, a CSV, a summary, a SQL query — your instinct is to check it by eye. Better instinct: **make Claude check it with commands, and show you the output.**

> Verify your own report: every quote must appear as an exact substring of the source file — check each one with `grep` and show me the result. The counts must sum to the row count. Recompute the percentages. Fix anything that fails and re-run.

Why this works when "are you sure?" doesn't: a command either passes or fails. `grep` finds the exact quote or it doesn't. Arithmetic sums or it doesn't. There's no "looks fine to me" in the loop — which is exactly the failure mode of asking a model to *reassure* you instead of *prove* it.

The shapes to reuse:

- **Quotes** → `grep -F` each one against the source file.
- **Numbers** → recompute independently from the raw data, compare.
- **Logic** (SQL, formulas) → build a tiny test dataset with known edge cases and *run it*. Don't review logic; execute it.
- **Claims** → for each one, quote the exact source sentence that supports it. No quote, no claim.

One more step and it's permanent: put the verification step in the folder's `CLAUDE.md`, so Claude runs it before declaring any output done — you can't forget what you've automated.

This is the habit that turns "I think the AI got it right" into "here's the command output that shows it did" — which is the sentence your boss actually wants to hear.
